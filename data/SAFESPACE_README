Notes on the SafeSpace Program
------------------------------------

To run the program, run "GUI.java" and it will display the interface.

When running the program, select 5 universities and their campuses, and five crimes, then press enter. After that, a button on the 
bottom right will show up that will say "Show More", which will do as it says. After clicking "Show More", another button will 
appear in its place that says "Compare Similar Size", which can also be clicked to compare to institutions of similar size.

Sometimes when a university is selected, the corresponding campus dropdown won't display any campuses. This error happens very infrequently
and is entirely random (I believe it happens when you select a university too quickly or something), and if that happens, the program can 
be restarted and re-run.

Five universities must be selected, cannot be less. Leaving an option blank will skew results.

VERY IMPORTANT: A lot of the institutions in the data set have a very little population and therefore zero crimes. Many "no name" 
universities were included in this data set, so when choosing five universities at random to test, there is a high chance one or several
of them will have a 'Safety Rank' of zero, because there are zero crimes at that university. Therefore a lot of the time when doing random
testing, it will display the safest university and it will have a 'Safety Rank' of zero in the output text area. If it has a ranking of zero,
when it compares to universities of similar size, it will display as Very Safe (because there are literally 0 crimes there).

Lastly, just to reiterate: Lower 'Safety Rank' == very safe university, Higher 'Safety Rank' == dangerous university.
