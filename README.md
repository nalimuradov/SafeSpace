# SafeSpace

Group project - Involved members include: Nariman Alimuradov, Prince Kowser, Teodor Tomescu, Moiz Qazi, Rafeh Hussain.

SafeSpace allows a user to choose 5 universities and their respective campuses, and 5 types of crimes that they want to avoid the most (eg. Arson, Murder). SafeSpace will then return the safest university out of the 5 selected. The safety ranking is based on how many crimes occur on the campus, what types of crimes, and how important they are for the user. It also compares the safest campus to campuses of similar size and sees if it is relatively safe/unsafe.
